### Snakemake installation and setup instructions ####
######################################################

teknonaturalist may be run using provided Snakemake and bash scripts. The program requires several programs that can be installed
### A. using Mamba (from mini forge) and Snakemake (recommended)
### B. using Conda/Mamba and Snakemake (not recommended)
### C. manually (may be used if Snakemake malfunctions)
NOTE: Mac devices equipped with ARM may require additional steps, which we include below. 
NOTE: Swapping the command 'conda' with 'mamba' (or vice versa) may be helpful in some cases. Ideally 'mamba' can be used for everything.

### Option 1. Docker - see README.md. This will cover Snakemake installation and teknonaturalist environment creation and activation.
	
### Option 2. Snakemake installation via Mamba installation
### A. Install Mamba using Miniforge, as noted here: 
# 	https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html
# Miniforge is available here:
#	https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge

### B. Install Snakemake, as noted here:
# 	https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html
# using these commands (if 'mamba' doesn't work, try using 'conda')
mamba activate base
#Note: The first time activating mamba, you may need to call it from the condabin directory. (e.g., <PATH>/miniforge3/condabin/mamba activate).
mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake

### Option 3. Snakemake installation via Mamba installation via Conda (not recommended)

# A. Install Conda, as noted here: 
#	https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html

# B. Once Conda is installed, install Mamba using Conda:
conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba

# C. Install Snakemake, as noted here:
# 	https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html
# using these commands (if 'mamba' doesn't work, try using 'conda')
mamba activate base
mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake

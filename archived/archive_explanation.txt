# One extremely minor step has been updated since conducting data analysis for our teknonaturalist paper,
# due to recent issues accessing fastx_toolkit using mamba. We hope this change will make life easier for new users. 
# We are keeping the original bash scripts used for our data analysis here for complete transparency. They are also present in earlier commits.

# fasta_formatter was originally used to convert multi-line sequence fasta files to single-line sequence fasta files:
fasta_formatter -i data/nonchimera/nonchimera.filtered.reads.2.${SRRnumber}.fasta | seqtk rename > data/nonchimera/chimera.filter.${SRRnumber}.fasta

# However, we now suggest using seqkit seq to perform the same function:
seqtk seq -i data/nonchimera/nonchimera.filtered.reads.2.${SRRnumber}.fasta | seqtk rename > data/nonchimera/chimera.filter.${SRRnumber}.fasta
